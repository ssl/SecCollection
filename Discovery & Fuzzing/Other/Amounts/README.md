# Amounts

Pre-generated wordlists based on [Common Security Issues in Financially-Oriented Web Applications](https://research.nccgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/common_security_issues_in_financially-orientated_web.pdf) PDF.

Created to fuzz amounts, quantities, or any other numerical values.

Bypass minimum and maximum restrictions, cause unintended behavior and errors, etc.

Tool to create such wordlists can be found at [ivan-sincek/amounts](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/amounts). Feel free to create and add more wordlists on your own. Works with integer and float numerical values.
